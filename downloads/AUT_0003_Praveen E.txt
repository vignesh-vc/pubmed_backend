AB  - Microangiopathic hemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, renal failure, neurologic 
      abnormalities, and fever form the pentad of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura 
      (TTP). Early diagnosis is crucial because TTP responds well to plasmapheresis 
      therapy but is associated with substantial mortality if left untreated. A 
      substantial percentage of patients with TTP used to die from systemic 
      microvascular thrombosis in the brain and the heart. However, since plasma 
      exchange therapy became a mainstay in the treatment of TTP, mortality has reduced 
      considerably. Diagnosing TTP can be difficult due to the vast range of symptoms 
      and the absence of clearly defined diagnostic criteria. Hemolytic uremic syndrome 
      and disseminated intravascular coagulation are a close differential of TTP. Here 
      we report two patients with TTP who achieved remission when treated with 
      steroids, plasmapheresis and were free of disease relapse till about two months 
      during follow-up in the outpatient department.

TI  - Changes in β-Cell Function in Offspring of Type-2 Diabetic Patients, as per 
      Fasting and Two-Hour Plasma Glucose Levels.
PG  - e15056

LID - e15056
AB  - Background The changes in β-cell function in high-risk populations who are 
      apparently in the normal glucose tolerant stage are still under investigation for 
      designing earlier prevention strategies. This study analyzes changes in β-cell 
      function and insulin sensitivity across fasting and two-hour glucose categories 
      spanning normal glucose tolerance (NGT) to impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), in 
      offspring of subjects with type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to the 
      controls without a known family history of T2DM. Methods Offspring of T2DM 
      patients (cases) and individuals without a family history of T2DM (controls) were 
      the subjects for this cross-sectional study. All participants underwent a 75 g 
      oral glucose tolerance test and blood samples were collected for plasma glucose, 
      insulin, C-peptide and proinsulin, at zero, 30, 60, and 120 minutes.  Results A 
      total of 358 cases (age 23.0 ± 10.8 years, 54% males) and 287 controls (age 28.4 
      ± 8.10 years, 65% males) were the subjects of this study. Cases and controls were 
      divided into subgroups based on fasting and two-hour glucose categories spanning 
      NGT to IGT. Compared to the reference category of controls (< 80 mg/dL for 
      fasting glucose and < 84 mg/dL for two-hour glucose), cases with IGT had ~60% 
      decline in both β-cell compensation (as measured as disposition index {0-120}) 
      and insulin sensitivity (as measured as whole-body insulin sensitivity index 
      {0-120}); adjusted for age, gender, and body mass index. From lower to higher 
      fasting and two-hour glucose categories, there was a continuous and significant 
      decline in β-cell compensation in both cases and controls. Significant reduction 
      in first-phase insulin secretion, as measured as insulinogenic (0-30) index, was 
      only observed among two-hour glucose categories, not among the fasting glucose 
      categories. In the transition from late NGT cases to IGT cases, there was a 
      significant decline in β-cell compensation, first-phase insulin secretion (more 
      prominent than a decline in overall β-cell secretion) and the changes in 
      whole-body insulin sensitivity were not statistically significant. Conclusions 
      The decline in β-cell compensation was continuous and significant in offspring of 
      subjects with type-2 diabetes and controls without a known family history of 
      diabetes from early normal glucose tolerant ranges to impaired glucose tolerant 
      ranges. Compared to the strictest glucose controlled category of controls, 
      approximately 60% decline was observed in β-cell compensation and insulin 
      sensitivity, in impaired glucose tolerant offspring of subjects with type-2 
      diabetes mellitus.
